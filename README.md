# Vencher

## What

It's a remake of Intendure (an old DOS game),
itself a remake of Adventure (an old Atari 2600 game),
itself a remake of the original text game, Adventure.

## Why

Game Jam 2018!

## How do I build it

There's a tiny "compile" shell script which will show you the way.
It's really just "gcc -o main src/*.c" plus SDL2 stuff (which may vary on your machine).

## How do I play

Just loading data structures for now...

## Anything else

I'm in a rush to complete the game jam, so... back to coding.
